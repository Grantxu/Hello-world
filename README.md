I am a father and have started to learn coding 2 weeks ago since my son is going to choose computer science as his major in college. Time is flying and I am getting old. But I do not want age to become a excuse for not learning the new things.My son and I live in the diifferent country and we could meet each every one or two years, so coding learning is the way to show my miss to him.

print("hello my son")
# Hello-son
